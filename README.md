## Continuing with C9 and While Loops

**Step 1: Clone this repo to Cloud9, then follow the instructions.**

We're are returning to learning about loops, but just in a different environment. These exercises are setup so that you can:

1. Get more practice with while loops
2. Get comfortable with C9, your new development environment
3. On Thursday, we will learn about for loops!
 
**Step 2: After cloning this repo, locate the console**


**Step 3: In the `<script></script>` tags in the header of the html file, complete the following exercises.**

You will need to check your work in the **console**

## JavaScript Exercises:

1. Write a while loop that prints "Justin Bieber" 10 times.
2. Using a while loop, print to the console starting from **77** up to, and including  **88**. 
3. Using a while loop, print to the console 1 to 10 except 7. **Hint: use if statements**
4. Using a while loop, add numbers 1 thru 20 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ... + 20). Print the sum to the console.
